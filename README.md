# Titanic-Kaggle
A solution of Kaggle's Titanic competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) using a number of classifiers and a stacking approach.

In the notebook we perform exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, fit a number of models and finally stack them with xgboost as 2nd level mode.
